### Database Schema (Supabase)
```sql
-- Core tables with progress tracking
users, user_credentials, resume_templates, job_sites, 
job_listings, applications, cover_letters, schedules,
notifications, agent_logs, user_preferences, project_tasks, 
progress_tracking, task_dependencies
```

- Handles encrypted credential decryption
- Fills forms and uploads documents
- Captures confirmation data

**6. Email Notification Agent**
- Sends status updates via Python smtplib
- Provides application summaries
- Handles error notifications
- Manages follow-up reminders

**7. Progress Tracking Agent**
- Monitors all task completion
- Updates project-plan.md and TASKS.md
- Generates status reports
- Tracks development milestones
