# InterviewAgent - AI-Powered Job Application System

## Project Overview
An intelligent automation system that helps job candidates apply to multiple positions by leveraging AI agents for resume optimization, cover letter generation, and automated job application submission.

## System Architecture

### Core Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Streamlit (Python web framework)
- **Backend**: Python with integrated Streamlit app
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Storage for files)
- **AI Agents**: OpenAI Python SDK with function calling
- **Web Automation**: Playwright Python library
- **Email**: Python smtplib + Gmail API
- **Authentication**: Single-user MVP (no auth initially)
- **Scheduling**: APScheduler for job automation
- **Progress Tracking**: Built-in task management system

### Database Schema (Supabase)
```sql
-- Core tables with progress tracking
users, user_credentials, resume_templates, job_sites, 
job_listings, applications, cover_letters, schedules,
notifications, agent_logs, user_preferences, project_tasks, 
progress_tracking, task_dependencies
```

### Agent System Architecture

**1. Main Orchestrator Agent**
- Manages workflow execution
- Coordinates between all sub-agents
- Handles error recovery and retries
- Tracks application metrics
- Updates progress tracking in real-time

**2. Job Discovery Agent**
- Scrapes configured job sites using Playwright Python
- Filters jobs based on user criteria
- Deduplicates across platforms
- Stores opportunities in Supabase

**3. Resume Optimization Agent**
- Analyzes job descriptions using AI
- Customizes resume content per job
- Generates optimized Word/PDF versions
- Stores versions in Supabase Storage

**4. Cover Letter Agent**
- Creates personalized cover letters
- Incorporates company research
- Matches job requirements
- Generates professional documents

**5. Application Submission Agent**
- Uses Playwright Python to navigate job sites
- Handles encrypted credential decryption
- Fills forms and uploads documents
- Captures confirmation data

**6. Email Notification Agent**
- Sends status updates via Python smtplib
- Provides application summaries
- Handles error notifications
- Manages follow-up reminders

**7. Progress Tracking Agent**
- Monitors all task completion
- Updates project-plan.md and TASKS.md
- Generates status reports
- Tracks development milestones

## Implementation Plan with Progress Tracking

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Target: Week 1-2) - ✅ COMPLETED
