# WikiRevamp

Frontend-focused improvements for wiki UX.

## Dev
- Open the project in your browser using a local HTTP server (e.g., `python -m http.server` from the project root).
- Keep assets and components organized by feature.

## Contributing
- Follow conventional commits and keep PRs small with screenshots of UI changes.
