Vibe Coding Journey: Day 4 — Exploratory Testing with AI-Powered Browser Automation

When AI Tests the Apps AI Built: A Real-Time Testing Adventure

A comprehensive exploratory testing session using Playwright MCP integration

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Today I conducted a comprehensive exploratory testing session on the CoachAI web application using AI-powered browser automation. This wasn't just testing — it was AI testing an AI-built app while documenting everything for future AI developers.

The meta level continues to astound me.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

The Testing Setup: AI-Powered Automation

Using Playwright MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration, I enabled Claude to directly control a browser and interact with the CoachAI application. This represents a new paradigm in testing:

Traditional Testing:
• Manual click-through by humans
• Scripted automation with predetermined paths
• Static test cases written in advance

AI-Powered Exploratory Testing:
• Dynamic test path generation
• Intelligent adaptation to UI changes
• Real-time bug discovery and documentation
• Context-aware testing decisions

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Test Session Overview: What We Discovered

Application Under Test: CoachAI Learning Platform
Testing Method: AI-controlled browser automation
Duration: 45 minutes of intensive exploration
Screenshots Captured: 11 key application states
Bugs Discovered: 2 critical issues
Features Tested: Learning Plan Creation, Navigation, Settings, Subscription Management

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

The Application: First Impressions

Screenshot 1: Initial Application Load

The CoachAI application loaded successfully with a clean, modern interface featuring:

✅ Professional dark theme with blue accent colors
✅ Clear navigation structure (Dashboard, Learning Plan, Settings)
✅ Brain emoji branding consistent throughout
✅ User statistics prominently displayed
✅ Intuitive step-by-step learning plan creation flow

Key Observations:
• Current Plan shows "Freemium" status
• Plans created today: 0/1 (indicating usage limits)
• Total learning time: 0 hours (new user experience)
• Clean, uncluttered interface design

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Critical Bug Discovery 1: Form Validation Issue

Screenshot 2-5: Learning Plan Creation Flow

During testing the core learning plan creation feature, I discovered a critical bug:

Issue: Form validation fails to recognize programmatically filled input fields

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Navigate to Learning Plan creation
2. Fill in topic field with "Advanced AI and Machine Learning with Python"
3. Click Next button
4. Error appears: "Please enter a topic to continue"

Expected Behavior: Form should accept the filled input and proceed to next step
Actual Behavior: Validation treats filled field as empty

Technical Analysis:
• Input field visually shows the entered text
• JavaScript value property contains the correct text
• Streamlit's reactive state management doesn't recognize programmatic input
• Form validation relies on Streamlit's internal state, not DOM values

Impact: HIGH
• Prevents core functionality from working
• Blocks user flow for learning plan creation
• Affects both manual and automated testing

Recommended Fix:
• Implement proper event dispatching for programmatic input
• Add fallback validation that checks DOM values
• Ensure Streamlit state synchronization with DOM changes

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Navigation Testing: Successful State Management

Screenshot 6-7: Application State Transitions

Navigation between sections worked flawlessly:

✅ Dashboard → Settings: Smooth transition
✅ Settings → Learning Plan: Maintains state
✅ Page reloads: Proper state restoration
✅ URL routing: Clean navigation without errors

The application demonstrated robust state management during navigation testing, with no broken links or loading errors encountered.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Settings Deep Dive: API Configuration

Screenshot 8: OpenAI API Settings

The Settings section revealed comprehensive configuration options:

API Settings Tab:
• OpenAI API key configuration
• Clear instructions for obtaining API keys
• Secure input field with password masking
• Green checkmark indicating valid API key status
• Expandable help section for API key setup

Technical Implementation Quality:
✅ Proper security practices (masked input)
✅ User-friendly guidance
✅ Visual feedback for configuration status
✅ Professional UI design

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Subscription Management: Comprehensive Feature Set

Screenshot 9-10: Subscription Interface

The subscription management system showed impressive depth:

Plans Comparison Table:
• Freemium: 1 plan/day, 3 resources, $0
• Premium: 10 plans/day, 10 resources, $9.99/month
• Feature differentiation: Email notifications, Progress tracking
• Clear visual indicators (✅/❌) for feature availability

Current Status Display:
• "Current Plan: Freemium" clearly shown
• Upgrade path prominently featured
• Detailed feature comparison
• Professional pricing presentation

Business Model Insights:
• Well-structured freemium model
• Clear value proposition for premium upgrade
• Reasonable pricing for target market
• Feature limitations encourage upgrades

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Dashboard Analytics: Data-Driven Learning

Screenshot 11: Learning Dashboard

The dashboard provided comprehensive learning analytics:

Key Metrics Displayed:
• Learning Time: 0 hours (with clear labeling)
• Tasks Completed: 0 (shows completion tracking)
• Weekly Activity Chart: Visual progress representation
• Time tracking prompt: "Generate a learning plan to start tracking"

Data Visualization:
✅ Clean bar chart for weekly activity
✅ Clear metric cards with descriptive labels
✅ Appropriate empty state messaging
✅ Encourages user engagement

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Critical Bug Discovery 2: Navigation State Issue

During navigation testing, I observed:

Issue: Clicking navigation buttons sometimes causes blank page loads

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Navigate from Learning Plan to Dashboard
2. Page briefly shows blank white screen
3. Content eventually loads after delay

Expected Behavior: Immediate navigation with loading indicators
Actual Behavior: Temporary blank state during transitions

Impact: MEDIUM
• Affects user experience
• Creates uncertainty during navigation
• May indicate performance issues

Recommended Fix:
• Implement proper loading states
• Add navigation transition indicators
• Optimize Streamlit page rendering

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

AI Testing Insights: What We Learned

Advantages of AI-Powered Testing:

1. Adaptive Problem Solving
When CSS selectors failed, Claude automatically switched to JavaScript-based element finding:

    const nextBtn = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('button'))
      .find(btn => btn.textContent.includes('Next'));

2. Intelligent Test Data Selection
Claude chose contextually relevant test data: "Advanced AI and Machine Learning with Python" — perfectly fitting the application's purpose.

3. Real-Time Documentation
Every action was automatically documented with screenshots and detailed observations, creating a comprehensive test report.

4. Bug Pattern Recognition
Claude identified that form validation issues were related to Streamlit's state management, not just simple UI problems.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
