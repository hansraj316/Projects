# Prompt Capture Session - 2025-06-22
## Building Universal Vibe Coding Blog Workflow

> **Meta Session**: Documenting the creation of the vibe coding documentation system itself

## Initial User Request
**Prompt 1**: "I want to track all the prompts and all the changes made as I am vibe coding through any app. Can you create a workflow for cursor and windsurf. Every change from planning to prompting to tracking these changes. Create all the files for cursor and windsurf to track all the changes in a .md file. Save it in the docs folder and create the instructions and rules file. Share how to set it up as well. This is usually a Streamlit webapp and a iOS app."

**AI Response**: Created comprehensive workflow system with multiple files including:
- DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW_TRACKING.md
- CURSOR_TRACKING_RULES.md  
- WINDSURF_TRACKING_RULES.md
- Session templates and automation scripts

## Refinement Request
**Prompt 2**: "The main purpose is to setup a blog after the implementation about usage of Vibe Coding for building an app and publish a blog. Can you update these files accordingly. Do not do anything else."

**AI Response**: Pivoted to blog-focused workflow with files:
- VIBE_CODING_BLOG_WORKFLOW.md
- BLOG_PUBLICATION_GUIDE.md
- Daily vibe log templates
- Blog session management script

## User Enhancement Phase
**User Action**: Made comprehensive updates to make system universal:
- Changed from CoachAI-specific to universal app development
- Added Cursor + Notion MCP integration
- Enhanced metrics tracking (business, team, platform-specific)
- Added deployment, security, performance considerations
- Created copy-paste Notion commands

## Validation Request  
**Prompt 3**: "Can you check the updates made and run the web app once"

**AI Response**: 
- Reviewed universal enhancements
- Successfully ran Streamlit app on localhost:8501
- Tested blog session script (created Day 1 session)
- Confirmed all systems working

## Meta Capture Request
**Prompt 4**: "Are you able to capture every prompt which i shared till now?"

**AI Response**: This document!
