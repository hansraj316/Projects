## Content Compilation Process

### Phase 1: Raw Material Review âœ…
```bash
# Compile all daily logs
find docs/blog_content/research/raw_notes -name "*.md" | sort

# Extract key moments
grep -r "Blog Gold Moments" docs/blog_content/research/raw_notes/
grep -r "Quotable" docs/blog_content/research/raw_notes/
grep -r "Breakthrough" docs/blog_content/research/raw_notes/
```

### Phase 2: Story Arc Development
```markdown
# Main Narrative Thread
1. **Discovery**: Realizing AI changes development fundamentally
2. **Setup**: Getting tools and mindset right  
3. **Learning**: The awkward dance of learning AI collaboration
4. **Mastery**: Developing effective patterns and techniques
5. **Creativity**: AI surprising with creative solutions
6. **Balance**: Finding the perfect human-AI partnership
7. **Results**: What got built and what it means for the future

# Character Development (You as Developer)
- Start: Curious but skeptical about AI assistance
- Middle: Struggling then discovering effective collaboration
- End: Confident AI-assisted developer with new perspective

# Supporting Characters
- **The AI**: From tool to partner to creative collaborator
- **The Code**: From manual craft to collaborative creation
- **The App**: CoachAI as the product of this new methodology
```
