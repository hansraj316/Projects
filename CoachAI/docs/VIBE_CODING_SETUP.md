# Vibe Coding Blog Setup Guide
## Quick Start for CoachAI Development Documentation

> **Goal**: Start documenting your AI-assisted development journey for blog publication in under 5 minutes

## 🚀 Instant Setup

### Step 1: Verify Structure (Already Done!)
Your blog tracking structure is now ready:
```
docs/blog_content/
├── posts/                     # Final blog posts
├── assets/                    # Screenshots, code examples, diagrams, demos
├── research/                  # Raw notes, insights, quotes
│   ├── raw_notes/            # Daily session logs
│   ├── insights/             # Development insights
│   └── quotes/               # Quotable moments
├── publication/              # Drafts, final posts, promotion
└── templates/                # Templates for consistent logging
```

### Step 2: Start Your First Session
```bash
# Start tracking your vibe coding journey
python scripts/blog_session.py start

# This creates: docs/blog_content/research/raw_notes/YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM_vibe_coding.md
```

### Step 3: Set Up Aliases (Optional but Recommended)
Add to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`:
```bash
# Vibe Coding Blog Aliases
alias vibe-start="python scripts/blog_session.py start"
alias vibe-note="python scripts/blog_session.py note"
alias vibe-insight="python scripts/blog_session.py insight"
alias vibe-quote="python scripts/blog_session.py quote"
alias vibe-demo="python scripts/blog_session.py demo"
alias vibe-summary="python scripts/blog_session.py compile"
```

Then reload: `source ~/.bashrc` or `source ~/.zshrc`
