## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Node.js (for projects using JavaScript/TypeScript)
- Git
- Virtual environment tools (`venv` or `virtualenv`)

### Environment Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the specific project directory you want to work on
3. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
4. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   # or for development dependencies
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```

## Project Structure

Each project follows its own structure, but common patterns include:

```
project-name/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/                    # Source code
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/                  # Test files
â”œâ”€â”€ docs/                   # Documentation
â”œâ”€â”€ config/                 # Configuration files
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt        # Python dependencies
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md              # Project-specific documentation
â””â”€â”€ venv/                  # Virtual environment (not committed)
```

## Development Workflow

### Branching Strategy

- `main` - Production-ready code
- `develop` - Integration branch for features
- `feature/*` - Feature development branches
- `bugfix/*` - Bug fix branches
- `hotfix/*` - Critical fixes for production

### Making Changes

1. Create a new branch from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Make your changes following the coding standards

3. Write or update tests as needed

4. Run tests to ensure nothing is broken:
   ```bash
   # Python projects
   python -m pytest
   
   # Node.js projects
   npm test
   ```

5. Update documentation if necessary

## Coding Standards

### Python Projects

- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Maximum line length: 88 characters (Black formatter compatible)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docstrings for classes and functions

### JavaScript/TypeScript Projects

- Use ESLint and Prettier for code formatting
- Follow ES6+ standards
- Use TypeScript where applicable
- Prefer const/let over var

### General Guidelines

- Write clear, self-documenting code
- Add comments for complex logic
- Avoid hardcoded values; use configuration files
- Handle errors gracefully
- Log important operations and errors

## Commit Guidelines

### Commit Message Format

Use conventional commit format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Types

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

### Examples

```bash
feat(auth): add JWT token authentication
fix(api): resolve user data validation error
docs: update installation instructions
refactor(database): optimize query performance
```

## Pull Request Process

1. **Before Creating a PR**
   - Ensure your code follows the style guidelines
   - Run all tests and make sure they pass
   - Update documentation if needed
   - Rebase your branch on the latest `main`

2. **Creating the PR**
   - Use a descriptive title
   - Fill out the PR template completely
   - Reference related issues using `#issue-number`
   - Add appropriate labels

3. **PR Requirements**
   - At least one approval from a maintainer
   - All CI checks must pass
   - No merge conflicts
   - Up-to-date with target branch

4. **After Approval**
   - Squash commits if requested
   - Maintainer will merge the PR

## Issue Reporting

### Bug Reports

Include:
- Clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Environment details (OS, Python version, etc.)
- Screenshots if applicable

### Feature Requests

Include:
- Clear description of the proposed feature
- Use case and benefits
- Possible implementation approach
- Any breaking changes

### Issue Labels

- `bug`: Something isn't working
- `enhancement`: New feature request
- `documentation`: Documentation related
- `good first issue`: Good for newcomers
- `help wanted`: Extra attention needed
- `priority/high`: High priority issue

## Security

### Reporting Security Issues

- **DO NOT** create public issues for security vulnerabilities
- Contact maintainers directly
- Provide detailed information about the vulnerability
- Allow time for the issue to be resolved before disclosure

### Security Best Practices

- Never commit sensitive data (API keys, passwords, etc.)
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Validate all user inputs
- Follow secure coding practices
- Keep dependencies updated

## Development Environment

### Recommended Tools

- **IDE**: VSCode with Python/JavaScript extensions
- **Code Formatting**: Black (Python), Prettier (JavaScript)
- **Linting**: Flake8/Pylint (Python), ESLint (JavaScript)
- **Testing**: pytest (Python), Jest (JavaScript)
- **Version Control**: Git with conventional commits

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file for local development (never commit this file):

```bash
# Example .env file
DEBUG=true
API_KEY=your-api-key-here
DATABASE_URL=your-database-url
```

## Testing

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for new features and bug fixes
- Aim for good test coverage
- Use descriptive test names
- Mock external dependencies
- Keep tests isolated and independent

### Running Tests

```bash
# Python projects
python -m pytest tests/
python -m pytest --cov=src tests/  # With coverage

# Node.js projects
npm test
npm run test:coverage
```

## Documentation

- Update README files for significant changes
- Add inline comments for complex code
- Update API documentation
- Include examples in documentation
- Keep documentation current with code changes

## Questions and Support

- Check existing issues and documentation first
- Use GitHub Discussions for questions
- Tag maintainers for urgent issues
- Be respectful and constructive in all interactions
